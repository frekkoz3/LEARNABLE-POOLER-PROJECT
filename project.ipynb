    "### **Literature Review**\n",
    "\n",
    "MaxPooling and AvgPooling are the default poolers in the majority of cases, mostly because they are easy to implement, fast at training and at inference, really intuitive and perform state of the art on traditional datasets as CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and MNIST. It also to be said that, a rule of thumb, should always be \"keep it simple\" (if possible) and those two poolers just fit perfectly. By the way researchers started to notice that sometimes they can be not enough, and a lot of time they cut out important information during the downsampling phase. In addiction they are static, meaning that they can not learn any parameter to improve their performance. Given this in mind researchers developed others poolers, some of them being differentiable and learnable, some of them being static but clever.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain more information about existing and novels poolers I searched on the literature and ended up with two main papers. The first one is *\"A Comparison of Pooling Methods for Convolutional Neural Networks\"* (Zafar et al. 2022) while the second one is *\"Generalizing Pooling Functions in CNNs: Mixed, Gated, and Tree\"* (Lee et al. 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "After studying them I decided to develop 4 different poolers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MixingPooling2d, a simple pooler that combines MaxPooling2d and AvgPooling2d with a learnable parameter (semi-static)\n",
    "2. GatedPooling2d, a pooler that combines MaxPooling2d and AvgPooling2s with a learnable gate (dynamic)\n",
    "3. StochasticPooling2d, a pooler that try to reduce overfitting introducing stochasticity inside the dunamic of pooling (static but stochastic)\n",
    "4. SP3Pooling2d, a novel pooler that aim to optimize the learning process introducing \"inner augmentation\" (static but stochastic)\n",
    "\n",
    "For MixingPooling2d and GatedPooling2d there were no need to find additional material. For StochasticPooling2d I retrieved its original paper *\"Stochastic Pooling for Regularization of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\"* (Zeiler & Fergus, 2013) and the same for SP3Pooling2d *\"S3Pool: Pooling with Stochastic Spatial Sampling\"* (Zhai et al. 2017)."

    "TDGS stands for \"Temperature Driven Gumbel SoftMax\".\\\n",

    "When $\\tau$ is low (<1) the GSM produces sharpened distribution centered in the max value (similarly to a MaxPool) while when $\\tau$$ is high (>1) the GSM produces softer distribution (similarly an uniform StochasticPool).\\\n",
    "The temperature parameter serves as balancer between deterministic behavior (which is somehow related to exploitation, MaxPool) and stochastic behavior (which is somehow related to exploration, Uniform StochasticPool).\\\n",
    "Developing a parameter per pooling patch (no temperature is shared) this can lead the architecture to learn specific spatial location where one strategy is better than the other.\n",

    "##### **Main Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the main challenges in developing this pooling function?\\\n",
    "We want to sample from a distribution parameterized by the parameter $\\tau$.\\\n",
    "The main problem is that it is not feasible to optimize the parameter of a probability distribution while sampling from it using backpropagation: it is non-differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, before diving in the solution, following this [tutorial](https://sassafras13.github.io/GumbelSoftmax/), let's dive in to some important aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Reparameterization trick**\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep it simple: if we want to perform sampling and optimization from a gaussian, $z \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, how can we do?\\\n",

    "[reparameterization](/imgs/reparameterizationtrick.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Gumbel SoftMax**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem now is that we want to sample from a categorical distribution. How to achieve this? We do this by computing the log probabilities of all the classes in the distribution (deterministic) and adding them to some noise (stochastic) from a Gumbel distribution. Once we have combined the two parts we can compute the SoftMax, which is full differentiable, even adding a learnable temperature parameter. In my developement I computed the log probabilites of the input divided by the learnable temperature parameter since I found it more effective. Visually this is what is happening:\n",
    "[gumbelsoftmax](/imgs/gumbelsoftmax.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical proof of why this actually works can be seen [here](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/the-gumbel-max-trick-for-discrete-distributions/). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Bringing all together**\n",
    "\n",
    "One must notice that in order to obtain the desired behavior from this pooling technique something is missing: now we have a \"softmax\" as ouput, but we want just a raw single value, and we do not want to use a weighted sum. Luckily the Pytorch [implementation](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.gumbel_softmax.html) provides a \"hard\" return mode. If True, the returned samples will be discretized as one-hot vectors, but will be differentiated as if it is the soft sample in autograd. Using the one-hot vector now we can actually use the weighted sum as output, since it will just be the desired sampled value.\\\n",
    "And this is \"it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Some little adjustments are also implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The temperature used while computing the log probabilities is not the raw temperature but a rectified one, to make it strictly positive\n",
    "2. A little epsilon is also added to the rectified temperature in order to prevent numerical errors\n",
    "3. Temperature is initialized from an Uniform distribution in $[0.5, 1.5]$ multiplied by an initial value\n",
    "4. During inference a weighted sum is performed as output (related to what done in StochasticPooling)"
